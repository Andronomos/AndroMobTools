# AndroTech

A WIP Minecraft mod that adds technology to the world.

The idea for this mod is the player is a member of an advanced alien race who has landed on the planet to start building infrastructure for a future colony.

## Blocks

### Mob Cloner
When a Dna Unit is placed inside this block, it will function as a spawner. Unlike a vanilla spawner, it can be moved, the entity nbt data is conserved and
the entity can be swapped by replacing the Dns Unit with another.

Can be disabled with a redstone signal

### Item Incinerator
Deletes any item placed into it.

### Item Attractor
Items in a 10x10 area around the block are sucked into it's inventory. Experience in a 10x10 area around the block is deleted (in the future I may add experience storage as well as my knowledge improves). 

### Mob Killing Pad
Kills any mob that steps on it. Can be upgraded by placing a looting or fire aspect book inside it.

### Weak Acceleration Pad
Accelerate any item or mob that lands on it.

### Strong Acceleration Pad
Accelerate any item or mob that lands on it.
