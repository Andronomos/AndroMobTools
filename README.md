# BlockPalette
BlockPalette is a building block mod for Minecraft with the goal of adding new or variants of vanilla blocks to make building a little more enjoyable.

Block recipes are designed to fit with vanilla and somewhat make sense. So no custom workbenches that let you swap variants or making glass from stone for example.
