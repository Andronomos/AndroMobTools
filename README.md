# About
BlockPalette is a building block mod for Minecraft with the goal of adding new or variants of vanilla blocks that fit my playstyle without feeling out of place or lacking a purpose.

In general building block mods tend to add many blocks without any sort of consistent theme or sensible recipes. This often leads to lots of blocks with random names that don't describe what they are (typically because they only exist for their texture and nothing more) and either recipes that are just as random or a new crafting table that simply lets you cycle through textures.

BlockPalette attempts to avoid this by making sure each block has a identity and a sensible recipe to match, rather than just being a random cube with a nice texture. By giving each block a identity, you make it easier to give it a name and recipe. This allows the mod to feel more cohesive and less tacked on to the gameplay. 

As an example, rough concrete is concrete, thus a building material (it's identity), but with a bit more noise in the texture and is crafted in the same way as vanilla concrete. First by making rough concrete powder, then placing it next to water. The power is made using stone, gravel and dye, pretty much what you would expect rough concrete to consist of.

So in short, you'll never see a block with a random or nonsensical name, a custom crafting table that lets you cycle block variants or a recipe made up of random items.
